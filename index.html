        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Born in 2125, Gideon grew up in an orphanage in Amsterdam, abandoned
          by his parents. His harsh early years molded him into the person he
          would become: a strategist, manipulator, and controller of his
          environment. The challenges he faced in his youth led to a sharp
          intellect and the development of supernatural abilities that would
          change his life forever.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gideon first discovered his powers as a teenager. Telepathy emerged
          first, followed by precognition, psychokinesis, and telekinesis. These
          abilities allowed him to manipulate and control others without them
          knowing. He realized early on that power wasn't in physical strength,
          but in controlling the unseen – thoughts, actions, and events.
        </p>

        <p>
          He spent years honing his abilities, eventually using his intellect
          and powers to rise above the ordinary constraints of life. His deep
          understanding of human nature and the world around him made him a
          formidable force in the shadows of society. As Specter, he created a
          secret network that extended his reach throughout Amsterdam, becoming
          a hidden force that controlled the city's power structures without
          ever stepping into the public eye.
